### REAL TIME CROP MONITORING USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

To Develop a real time land usage monitoring tool using Satellite data and Artificial Intelligence

# ABSTRACT:
 The  temperature change and its unpredictability, has caused majority of the agricultural crops in  production and maintenance.
 • Forecasting or predicting the crop yield well prior to its harvest time would assist the farmers for taking appropriate measures for mercantilism and storage.
• Correct prediction of crop development stages plays a crucial role in crop production management.
Crop monitoring and forecasting of crop yields for the proposed system are going to be dole out via satellite pictures with low resolution.
• The combination of extensive and extended topographic coverage and its high temporal frequency build these pictures an appropriate choice for the prediction of crop yields and these pictures are trained using artificial intelligence.
• The paradigm distinguishes between crops, 
the infrared and temperature bands of pictures taken throughout apex season contribute the foremost  to the crop prediction.
• The main aim is to match the output of crops to verify whether or not the results are correct for crop yield forecasting then these output are 
going to be displayed in the map. 

     Agriculture is one of the most predominant sector in India.Agriculture produces more than 25% GDP to our country.
According to the Harvard , Food demand is expected to increase between 59% to 98% by 2050. Farmers worldwide will need to increase crop production, 
either by increasing the amount of agricultural land or by enhancing productivity.


## Our project demonstrates the capabilities of field monitoring, crop growth analysis and yield prediction with the help of Artificial Intelligence. And it also helps in monitoring the growth of healthy crops as well.
